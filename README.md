# C-MenuManager-altv
C# Wrapper for NativeUI of datWeazel

Wrapper is based on leshred's serverside MenuManager for GT-MP

See https://github.com/datWeazel/alt-V-NativeUI for settings up NativeUI on Clientside

Put the MenuManager folder inside your Server-Project, link the events in MenuManager.cs and you're ready to go.
The NativeUI is modified and thus only allowing one menu to render.
